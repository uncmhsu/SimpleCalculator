# SimpleCalculator
A simple calculator application created using the Java MVC (Model View Controller) design pattern.

Adds and subtracts integer values.

This project was great for taking what I had learned from lectures and online tutorials about the Java MVC design pattern, and putting it into practice. 

I was able to use the Java MVC concept, and build a working application.

This project served as a great practice for me to gain hands-on experience with building applications that utilize MVC (which I will have to build later for a class project), and to fully grasp the concept and real-world application of the Java MVC.

I am also extremely thankful for my lecture notes, as well as the many online educational websites and tools that have helped me to learn and understand the MVC design pattern.
